#GroGreen
GroGreen was built by Rachel Sterneck and Priya Mittal for the Technovation Challenge 2016.

GroGreen is an iOS application that aims to eliminate food waste by connecting farms to restaurants local to New York City. We were inspired to combat this issue after noticing how often people avoid produce that appears ugly, but tastes delicious. GroGreen allows restaurants to order directly from farms by displaying a list of produce they can buy. Once a restaurant places an order to a farm, the farm receives the order in real-time. GroGreen also keeps track of orders that have been completed. With GroGreen, our goal is to reduce waste by encouraging restaurants to purchase imperfect produce.

GroGreen was built using Swift, Xcode, and Firebase.
